this course is an introduction to the finite element method as applicable to a range of problems in physics and engineering sciences the treatment is mathematical but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation the emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern open source environment that can be expanded to other applications subsequently the course includes about hours of lectures covering the material i normally teach in an introductory graduate class at university of michigan the treatment is mathematical which is natural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus it is not formal however because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a competent developer of finite element code we do spend time in rudimentary functional analysis and variational calculus but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the methods which in turn explains why they work so well much of the success of the finite element method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical foundation and this needs to be appreciated even if only in the elementary manner presented here a background in pdes and more importantly linear algebra is assumed although the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed the development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations pdes elliptic parabolic and hyperbolic at each stage however we make numerous connections to the physical phenomena represented by the pdes for clarity we begin with elliptic pdes in one dimension linearized elasticity steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion we then move on to three dimensional elliptic pdes in scalar unknowns heat conduction and mass diffusion before ending the treatment of elliptic pdes with three dimensional problems in vector unknowns linearized elasticity parabolic pdes in three dimensions come next unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion and the lectures end with hyperbolic pdes in three dimensions linear elastodynamics interspersed among the lectures are responses to questions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post doctoral scholars who followed the lectures live at suitable points in the lectures we interrupt the mathematical development to lay out the code framework which is entirely open source and c based books there are many books on finite element methods this class does not have a required textbook however we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader treatments than can be provided in any form of class the finite element method linear static and dynamic finite element analysis tjr hughes dover publications the finite element method its basis and fundamentals oc zienkiewicz rl taylor and jz zhu butterworth heinemann a first course in finite elements j fish and t belytschko wiley resources you can download the dealii library at dealiiorg the lectures include coding tutorials where we list other resources that you can use if you are unable to install dealii on your own computer you will need cmake to run dealii it is available at cmakeorg

our relationship to beethoven is a deep and paradoxical one for many musicians he represents a kind of holy grail his music has an intensity rigor and profundity which keep us in its thrall and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive technical and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers at the same time beethoven s music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined two hundred years after his death he is everywhere in the culture yet still represents its summit this course takes an inside out look at the piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of beethoven s music exemplified by it these might include the relationship between beethoven the pianist and beethoven the composer the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing the course will feature some analysis and historical background but its perspective is that of a player not a musicologist its main aim is to explore and demystify the work of the performer even while embracing the eternal mystery of beethoven s music itself this season s curtis courses are sponsored by linda richardson in loving memory of her husband dr paul richardson the dolfinger mcmahon foundation supports curtis s lifelong learning initiatives

with its walls razed to ground by babylon s armies jerusalem joined a long line of ancient vanquished cities from ur and nineveh and persepolis to babylon itself while some recovered from the destruction others did not but none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the bible most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame they consigned it to oblivion opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past the biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure reflect deeply upon its causes and discover thereby a ground for collective hope working through colorful biblical and ancient near eastern texts and drawing on an array of comparative examples the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center the aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text which includes stories and songs wisdom and laws this corpus of writings belongs without a doubt to humanity s greatest achievements whereas the great civilizations of the near east invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day more important these authors visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life

this seven week course will explore the relationship between law and technology with a strong focus on the law of the united states with some comparisons to laws around the world especially in europe tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government and technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright antitrust patents privacy speech law and the regulation of networks the course will explore seven topics microsoft the desktop vs the internet we will start with a look at the technology path that led to the first personal computer in early the altair that path starts with the vacuum tube moves to transistors then to integrated circuits and finally to the microprocessor we will look at the early days of software on the personal computer and the competition between selling software and open source approaches as well as the problem of software piracy we will discus the public good nature of software the launch of the ibm pc revolutionized the personal computer market and started the path to microsoft s powerful position and eventual monopoly in that market with the selection of ms dos we then turn to four antitrust cases against microsoft the us case relating to ms dos licensing practices the us antitrust middleware case over microsoft s response to netscape navigator the european union case regarding windows media player and the eu browser case over internet explorer these disputes arose at the point of maximal competition between the free standing personal computer and the internet world that would come after it and we may know enough now to assess how these cases influenced that competition google emerges and the world responds google has emerged as one of the dominant platforms of the internet era and that has led to corresponding scrutiny by regulators throughout the world decisions that google makes about its algorithm can be life altering individuals are finding it more difficult to put away past mistakes as google never forgets and businesses can find that their sales plummet if google moves them from the first page of search results to a later page with great power comes scrutiny and we will look at how government regulators have evaluated how google has exercised its power both the us federal trade commission and the european union have undertaken substantial investigations of google s practices and we will look at both of those smartphones the internet started on the desktop but the internet is increasingly mobile and people are seemingly tethered to their smartphones and tablets and we have seen an interesting shift in that market away from nokia handsets and the blackberry to apple s iphone and its ios platform and to the android platform the legal infrastructure of smartphones and tablets is extraordinarily complex we will start by looking at us spectrum policy and the effort to free up megahertz of spectrum we will look at the activities of standard setting organizations including the ieee and the creation of the standard and wi fi or if you prefer wifi the creation of patent pools and the regulation of standard essential patents we will look at the ftc action against google motorola mobility and apple s lawsuit against samsung over utility and design patents relating to the iphone finally we will take a brief look at the european commission s investigation into the android platform nondiscrimination and network neutrality facebook has more than billion users and measure that against a world population of roughly billion and a total number of internet users of roughly billion a course on law and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework for regulating the internet and a key idea there is the notion of network neutrality nondiscrimination obligations are frequent in regulated network industries but at the same discrimination can be an important tool of design for communication networks we will start our look at the internet by looking at the great first communications network of the united states the post office and will look in particular at the post office act of we will then move to modern times and will consider efforts by the us federal communications commission to produce sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions for the internet and will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world the day the music died in many ways the internet came first to music with the rise of peer to peer p p music sharing through napster and its successors we start with a look into music platform history and the devices that brought recorded music into the home the phonograph and the player piano we turn to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves the performing rights organizations like ascap and bmi we look at the antitrust issues associated with the blanket license we consider a failed music platform digital audio tape and the complicated legal regime associated with it the audio home recording act of we will consider the copyright issues raised by the creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p p technologies such as napster and grokster the music industry responded to p p technology by adding digital rights management tools to cds as music distribution switched from physical media to digital distribution we entered the world of apple and the ipod and itunes we consider the drm issues associated with apple s music platform as seen by steve jobs we conclude by looking at emerging subscription services like spotify and the service that apple is building based on its purchase of beats video listening and watching images are some of the most powerful ways in which ideas and speech are communicated and video has long been regulated by the state that starts as a communications law issue with government regulation of the radio spectrum but also leads to the design of the television system with the assignment of channels and eventually the definition of digital television and with the emergence first of cable tv and subsequently the vcr critical copyright roadblocks had to be overcome for new distribution technologies to emerge we will consider the legal engineering that led to the dvd platform which was an exercise in patent pools and trademark creation we will sort through the creation of the digital tv platform and will also look at the copyright underpinnings for netflix and we will consider the question of technology neutrality in the content of the copyright fight over a new video distribution entrant aereo finally we close the week with a brief look at the incentive spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast television the mediated book gutenberg revolutionized books with his printing press and for academics books are sacred objects but the printed book is on the run and with the rise of the ebook we are entering a new era the era of the mediated book this is more than just a change in technology we will

the goal of this mooc is to show that econometric methods are often needed to answer questions a question comes first then data are to be collected and then finally the model or method comes in depending on the data however it can happen that methods need to be adapted for example where we first look at two variables later we may need to look at three or more or when data are missing what then do we do and if the data are counts like the number of newspaper articles citing someone then matters may change too but these modifications always come last and are considered only when relevant an important motivation for me to make this mooc is to emphasize that econometric models and methods can also be applied to more unconventional settings which are typically settings where the practitioner has to collect his or her own data first such collection can be done by carefully combining existing databases but also by holding surveys or running experiments a byproduct of having to collect your own data is that this helps to choose amongst the potential methods and techniques that are around if you are searching for a mooc on econometrics that treats mathematical and statistical methods of econometrics and their applications you may be interested in the coursera course econometrics methods and applications that is also from erasmus university rotterdam

it s clear that the world needs more intellectual humility but how do we develop this virtue and why do so many people still end up so arrogant do our own biases hold us back from becoming as intellectually humble as we could be and are there some biases that actually make us more likely to be humble which cognitive dispositions and personality traits give people an edge at being more intellectually humble and are they stable from birth learned habits or something in between and what can contemporary research on the emotions tell us about encouraging intellectual humility in ourselves and others experts in psychology philosophy and education are conducting exciting new research on these questions and the results have important real world applications faced with difficult questions people often tend to dismiss and marginalize dissent political and moral disagreements can be incredibly polarizing and sometimes even dangerous and whether it s christian fundamentalism islamic extremism or militant atheism religious dialogue remains tinted by arrogance dogma and ignorance the world needs more people who are sensitive to reasons both for and against their beliefs and are willing to consider the possibility that their political religious and moral beliefs might be mistaken the world needs more intellectual humility in this course we will examine the following major questions about the science of intellectual humility how do we become intellectually humble what can human cognition tell us about intellectual humility how does arrogance develop and how can we become more open minded how do emotions affect our ability to be intellectually humble all lectures are delivered by leading specialists and the course is organised around a number of interesting readings and practical assignments which will help you address issues related to humility in your daily life this course can be taken as a part of a series which explores the theory the science and the applied issues surrounding intellectual humility in the previous course on the theory behind intellectual humility we considered how to define intellectual humility the nature of an intellectual virtue and how we know who is intellectually humble if you are interested complete all three courses to gain a broader understanding of this fascinating topic look for intellectual humility theory https wwwcourseraorg learn intellectual humility theory intellectual humility practice https wwwcourseraorg learn intellectual humility practice
according to steven blank a business startup or any new venture startup is essentially a proto type thus the startup process essentially becomes a learning process to refine that business proto type into a scalable replicable finished product at the end of this course learners will be able to complete a business model summarizing assumptions about what value they will offer to whom and how they will make money systematically test and validate these assumptions within the constraints of their available resources and use these validated assumptions to generate financial projections that are based on actual resources and efforts expended the days of the page business plan have certainly passed but the role of planning in the business creation process is one of extreme importance in this course we will explore the important components that you need to explore in detail prior to business creation action without planning is a recipe for disaster and we will make sure you have a rock solid foundation for future actions the planning here is focused on learning it is unrealistic for anyone to document in detail all of the actions they should take to make a new venture or activity successful when they and often no one else has any experience with the new venture and the conditions which it is likely to face thus the business plan based largely on assumptions and aggregate non applicable data is replaced with the business model which organizes the key assumptions determining what value the business will offer to whom and how it will make money the course will guide learners through the process of systematically testing and validating these assumptions and obtaining specific applicable data it will then show learners how to use these validated assumptions to generate pro forma financial statements directly tied to actions and resources based on this business model

the last three or four decades have seen a remarkable evolution in the institutions that comprise the modern monetary system the financial crisis of is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system produced and sponsored by the institute for new economic thinking this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant three features of the new system are central most important the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities the financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see the result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this and then that in an effort to stem the collapse second the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order third absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory that s the reason this course places dealers in both capital markets and money markets at the very center of the picture as profit seeking suppliers of market liquidity to the new system of market based credit

before the advent of quantum mechanics in the early th century most scientists believed that it should be possible to predict the behavior of any object in the universe simply by understanding the behavior of its constituent parts for instance if one could write down the equations of motion for every atom in a system it should be possible to solve those equations with the aid of a sufficiently large computing device and make accurate predictions about that system s future however there are some systems that defy this notion consider a living cell which consists mostly of carbon hydrogen and oxygen along with other trace elements we can study these components individually without ever imagining how combining them in just the right way can lead to something as complex and wonderful as a living organism thus we can consider life to be an emergent property of what is essentially an accumulation of constituent parts that are somehow organized in a very precise way this course lets you explore the concept of emergence using examples from materials science mathematics biology physics and neuroscience to illustrate how ordinary components when brought together can collectively yield unexpected surprising behaviors note the fractal image sierpinkski triangle depicted on the course home page was generated by a software application called xaos which is distributed by the free software foundation under a gnu general public license upon completing this course you will be able to explain the difference in assumptions between an emergent versus reductive approach to science explain why the reductivist approach is understood by many to be inadequate as a means of describing and predicting complex systems describe how the length scale used to examine a phenomenon can contribute to how you analyze and understand it explain why the search for general principles that explain emergent phenomena make them an active locus of scientific investigation discuss examples of emergent phenomena and explain why they are classified as emergent

process mining is the missing link between model based process analysis and data oriented analysis techniques through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains data science is the profession of the future because organizations that are unable to use big data in a smart way will not survive it is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis the data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis process mining bridges the gap between traditional model based process analysis eg simulation and other business process management techniques and data centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining process mining seeks the confrontation between event data ie observed behavior and process models hand made or discovered automatically this technology has become available only recently but it can be applied to any type of operational processes organizations and systems example applications include analyzing treatment processes in hospitals improving customer service processes in a multinational understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site analyzing failures of a baggage handling system and improving the user interface of an x ray machine all of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models hence we refer to this as data science in action the course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining participants will learn various process discovery algorithms these can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented moreover the course will provide easy to use software real life data sets and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains this course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process re design then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling the course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments the course covers the three main types of process mining the first type of process mining is discovery a discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a priori information an example is the alpha algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model a petri net explaining the behavior recorded in the log the second type of process mining is conformance here an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process conformance checking can be used to check if reality as recorded in the log conforms to the model and vice versa the third type of process mining is enhancement here the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a priori model an example is the extension of a process model with performance information eg showing bottlenecks process mining techniques can be used in an offline but also online setting the latter is known as operational support an example is the detection of non conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place another example is time prediction for running cases ie given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management it also helps to address the classical divide between business and it evidence based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development the course uses many examples using real life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms after taking this course one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the business process intelligence field after taking this course you should have a good understanding of business process intelligence techniques in particular process mining understand the role of big data in today s society be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation business intelligence data mining machine learning and verification be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log both manually and using tools be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models both manually and using tools be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log eg show bottlenecks have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data explain how process mining can also be used for operational support prediction and recommendation and be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner

wondering why economists have not predicted serious financial crises shocked by economic assumptions of human behavior as self centered and focusing only on what can be measured asking yourself if there are no sensible economic alternatives to free markets then you are at the right place to learn economics this is the first online course that teaches economics from a pluralist perspective economic pluralism means that a plurality of theoretical and methodological viewpoints is regarded as valuable in itself and is simply the best way in which economics can make progress in understanding the world this mooc will illustrate economic pluralism not only in substance but also in form you will see not only me a professor of economics but also a pop up prof of our business school who illustrates the actor perspective of firms government and civil society and you will meet an online student based in greece who will help you through the tutorial videos in which i will explain key concepts tools and techniques i will not limit myself to the dominant theory as almost every other course does instead i will introduce you to four very different economic theories for the whole set of standard topics in microeconomics and macroeconomics the theories are presented every time from broad and more interdisciplinary to narrow and more mathematical the four theories that i like to introduce you to are social economics institutional economics post keynesian economics and at the very end of each topic neoclassical economics for the special case of ideally functioning markets but not everything is different in this course like every economics course it includes numbers diagrams tables equations and some calculations why would you go through the effort of learning the basics of four theories instead of one because it will help you to see why many economists cannot predict crises whereas others can see signals but are often not being listened to because they do not belong to the dominant school of thought it will also enable you to see that it is just one theory claiming economic agents to be self centered and focusing on the measurable only other economic theories go well beyond these limitations and finally the pluralist approach will provide you with policy alternatives to neoliberalist policies promoting free markets the objective of this course is twofold first to enable you to understand different economic viewpoints linked to important traditions in economic thought and basic economic concepts belonging to these theoretical perspectives second to enable you to do some basic economic calculations that are important in economic life such as calculating an inflation rate and in economic policies such as estimating the rough gains from trade for both trading partners and in economic arguments such as in calculating utility maximization with given prices and budgets i hope you will enjoy the course
