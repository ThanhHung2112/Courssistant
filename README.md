# Courssistant
**Courssistant** (Course - Assistant) is an innovative chatbot designed to support users on an online education platform by initially focusing on essential features. It aims to assist users in navigating the platform effectively, providing foundational support such as course discovery, policy clarification, and basic information retrieval.

Initially, Courssistant will prioritize functionalities like guiding users through course selection based on their preferences and skill levels. It will also handle queries related to platform policies and provide clear explanations on course content.

Future enhancements will include advanced capabilities such as answering assignment queries and explaining formulas through video demonstrations, enriching the user experience with deeper interactive learning support.

By focusing on foundational features first, Courssistant aims to establish a reliable and user-friendly support system that evolves with user needs and advances in educational technology.
